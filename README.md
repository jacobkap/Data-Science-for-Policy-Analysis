# Data Science for Policy Analysis 
Policy analysts face unique challenges at their work. They need to transform data that were gathered or generated for a variety of administrative purposes into useful information for the policy makers. They also need to uncover hidden structure of the data they have transformed and visualize their findings to communicate as well as persuade stakeholders to support particular policies or programs. 

This repository contains a series of lessons designed to introduce essential elements of data science to policy analysts. We have used these lessons to teach Master of Public Administration students at Fels Institute of Government at University of Pennsylvania. The students have taken one semester of statistic course before they begin these lessons. But these lessons do not require deep knowledge of mathematical statistics or econometrics. We do assume that the students have limited familiarity with R and R-studio. 

The primary textbook for the course is R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham at http://r4ds.had.co.nz/. Hence, these lessons teach students how to use R within the framework of tidyverse. The official resource for tidyverse is www.tidyverse.org.
