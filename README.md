# Data Science for Policy Analysis 
Policy analysts face unique challenges at their work. They need to transform data that were gathered or generated for a variety of administrative purposes into useful information for the policy makers. They often combined these adminstrative data with a variety of data sources including survey data including the American Community Surveys or the Current Population Surveys. They also need to uncover hidden structure of the data they have transformed and visualize their findings to communicate as well as persuade stakeholders to support particular policies or programs. 

This repository contains a set of scripts designed to introduce essential elements of data science to policy analysts. We have used these scripts to teach Master of Public Administration students at Fels Institute of Government at University of Pennsylvania. The students have taken one semester of statistic course before they begin using these scripts. But these scripts only require intuitive knowledge of mathematical statistics or econometric. We do assume that the students have limited familiarity with R and R-studio. 

The primary textbook for the course is R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham at http://r4ds.had.co.nz/. Hence, these lessons teach students how to use R within the framework of tidyverse. The official resource for tidyverse is www.tidyverse.org.
