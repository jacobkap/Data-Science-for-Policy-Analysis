# Data Science for Policy Analysis: an Introduction with R
Policy analysts face unique challenges. They need to transform data that was gathered or generated for administrative purposes into useful information for decision makers. In this transformation, they often combine adminstrative data with a variety of data sources, including national surveys like the American Community Surveys (ACS) or the Current Population Surveys (CPS). To accomplish their objective, they need to uncover the hidden structure of the data and visualize their findings to communicate, as well as persuade stakeholders to support particular policies or programs. 

To overcome these challenges, policy analysts need to master specific analytical skills. This repository contains a set of R scripts designed to introduce essential elements of data science to policy analysts. We have used these scripts to teach Master of Public Administration (MPA) students at Fels Institute of Government at University of Pennsylvania. These scripts are based on *R for Data Science* (http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. However, we significantly altered the order of skills being introduced to the students and replace data with those that are more relevant to policy analysts.

Learning data science with R is difficult for many of our students. Most existing textbooks on the subject are written by data scientists with very different backgrounds and experiences. For instance, most textbooks on the subject begin with a chapter introducing vectors and matrices, yet the most common form of data objects that policy analysts have to work with are data frames. Moreover, students are expected to persevere for few more chapters before they learn a skill that they can use to create something interesting. Even when a skill like visualization is introduced, most textbooks concentrate on techniques that are suitable for working with continuous (or numeric) variables, but analysts are more likely to be working with categorical variables. 

More importantly, most textbooks concentrate on statistical models that are too complex for analysts to effectively explain the results to decision makers and stakeholders. Very few textbooks teach how to effectively design and use crosstabulations that are essential in making sense of covariations among categorical variables. R scripts in this repository, however, are designed to meet the needs of policy analysts. We concentrate on essential skills that policy analysts are most likely to use in their daily work. 

*R for Data Science* offers a unique approach to teaching data science with R. The authors introduce R by teaching visualization skills using a package called ggplot at the beginning of the book. Our students enjoy learning to make attractive graphs with ggplot. In addition, the authors teach students how to use R within the framework of tidyverse (www.tidyverse.org). 

Our students have already taken one semester of a statistic course before they begin using these scripts, but these scripts only require intuitive knowledge of mathematical statistics or econometrics. We do, however, assume that the students have some familiarity with R and R-studio. Policy analysts who are not familiar with R can learn its basics using Script_0.R and Introduction_to_R.pdf in this repository. In addition, we also created two instructional videos to introduce basics of R.
